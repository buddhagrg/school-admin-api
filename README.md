## School Admin
School Admin is a user friendly web application for school administration built on top of React, Redux toolkit, NodeJS and PgSQL.

## Repo Overview
This repo is for api. Currently, [https://nodemailer.com/] nodemailer is used for email sending during registration, password setup and password change. So, to run this project successfully on your local machine, you first need an gmail service with App password feature enabled through which you can get the password and use in the env (**MAIL_AUTH_PWD** and **MAIL_AUTH_USER**). You need to create a **.env** file (Example in [example.env](https://github.com/buddhagrg/school-admin-api/blob/master/example.env)  )
